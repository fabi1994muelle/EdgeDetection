# Vision Programming Challenge

Unfortunately, I did not manage to complete the task. Installing ROS and initializing the projects and the robot was no problem. First I created a project to try out the subscriber and publisher functions. So I could use the Point Cloud as sensor_msg. I saved the point clouds as a file and visualized them with another project.
In the saved point clouds I could not yet imagine which corner points I should recognize. Only when I had found the function in the gui to visualize the point cloud.

I guess the task was also to visualize the checkerboard points.

I probably should have used sesor on the image and opencv for evaluation.
I used the pcl library. Unfortunately, I haven't found a useful function to extract image data from the point cloud.

Sorry for the bad performance on my side. At least I could get experience with Ros pcl and C++.
